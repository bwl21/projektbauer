    # The hook program typically does not inherit the environment of
    # its parent process.  For example, a common problem is for the
    # PATH environment variable to not be set to its usual value, so
    # that subprograms fail to launch unless invoked via absolute path.
    # If you're having unexpected problems with a hook program, the
    # culprit may be unusual (or missing) environment variables.
    # 
    # Here is an example hook script, for a Unix /bin/sh interpreter.
    # For more examples and pre-written hooks, see those in
    # /usr/share/subversion/hook-scripts, and in the repository at
    # http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/tools/hook-scripts/ and
    # http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/contrib/hook-scripts/
